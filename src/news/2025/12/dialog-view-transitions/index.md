Thomas Günther explores how to combine two modern web APIs, the `<dialog>` element and View Transition API, to create smooth animations when opening and closing dialogs. The technique uses `document.startViewTransition()`, `showModal()`, and `close()` calls, with a shared `view-transition-name` to link elements. This progressive enhancement ensures accessibility and works across major browsers, apart from `closedby` missing from Safari.
