At ViteConf, Evan You announced Vite+, a new layer on top of Vite that brings together project creation, building, testing, linting, formatting, library bundling, and visual tools in one environment. The entire toolchain is written in Rust and works with React, Vue, SvelteKit, and other frameworks. Vite+ will be free for individual and open-source projects but will require a commercial license for businesses.
