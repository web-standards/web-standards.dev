Loren Stewart compared 10 meta-frameworks: Marko, SolidStart, SvelteKit, Qwik, and Nuxt deliver FCP between 35–39 ms and bundles from 28.8 to 176.3 kB. The key takeaway is React’s architectural ceiling: even TanStack Start on React ships bundles twice as large as the same setup with Solid; Angular via Analog remains heavy, while Vue via Nuxt is quite competitive. MPA frameworks like Marko and HTMX ship minimal JS per page, while SPAs pay the baseline runtime cost.
