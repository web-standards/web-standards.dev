Mason Freed announced Chromiumâ€™s plan to fully remove support for XSLT, the XML transformation technology standardized back in 1999. The decision comes from its extremely low usage (around 0.05% of page loads) and serious security risks. WHATWG, Firefox, and Safari expressed support. Deprecation will begin in Chrome 143, with full removal planned for version 155 and a transition period lasting until 2027.
