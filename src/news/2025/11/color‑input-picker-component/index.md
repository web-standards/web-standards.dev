Adam Argyle’s tool supports wide‑gamut colors (sRGB, Display P3, Rec2020) with automatic detection and converts between sRGB, HSL, HWB, LAB, LCH, OKLCH and OKLAB. Built with Color.js, Preact Signals and Shadow DOM, it’s customizable via CSS parts and tree‑shakeable ES modules. The custom element auto‑registers on import, works in browsers with the Popover API and positions itself intelligently.
